The recommended way to install the package is to use a release
archive.  Using this method will also install the pre-built Info
manual.  The following example shows shell commands which will
extract, configure, build, and install the package, assuming that the
installation should be system-wide:

@example sh
tar -xf kixtart-mode-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
cd kixtart-mode-@value{VERSION}
./configure
make
# System-wide installation will likely require root privileges.
sudo make install
@end example

Alternatively, to use the latest development version of the package,
the repository can be cloned to a location which is present in the
Emacs @code{load-path}.

To clone the repository to a local subdirectory:

@example sh
git clone https://git.sr.ht/~mew/kixtart-mode
@end example

The value of @code{load-path} can be modified in the Emacs
configuration, although such a change will need to placed before any
actions which attempt to load the package.  The following example
assumes that the repository has been cloned within a directory named
"manual-packages" within the user's ".emacs.d" directory:

@example lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/manual-packages/kixtart-mode")
@end example
