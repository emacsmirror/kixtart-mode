KiXtart Mode is an Emacs major mode for creating and editing KiXtart
script files.  The following features are implemented:

   * Syntax highlighting for commands, functions, labels, and macros.
   * Indentation based on the usage of commands and parentheses.
   * Motion around and selection of defined functions.
   * Imenu support for function and label names.
   * ElDoc support for display of documentation.
   * Completion for built-in syntax (commands, functions, and macros).
   * Current function name for which-function-mode and add-log
     functions.
   * Outline Mode support.
   * Predefined Tempo templates with optional abbrev expansion.

See the manual for full details.

Installation
============

Clone this repository to a local subdirectory:

     git clone https://git.sr.ht/~mew/kixtart-mode

Within the Emacs configuration, add the path of the cloned directory to
the value of 'load-path'.  The following example assumes that the
repository was cloned within a directory named "manual-packages" within
the user's ".emacs.d" directory:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/manual-packages/kixtart-mode")

Example configuration
=====================

Assuming that the KiXtart Mode package is currently not loaded, the
following example demonstrates how to load the package, configure some
basic settings, and enable some optional features:

     ;; Load the package by searching in paths listed in `load-path'.
     (require 'kixtart-mode)

     ;; Load the default docstrings.
     (require 'kixtart-docstrings)

     ;; Set indentation and fill preferences.
     (add-hook 'kixtart-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (indent-tabs-mode 1)
                 (setq tab-width 4)
                 (setq fill-column 80)))

     ;; Set template insertion to use interactive prompts.
     (setq tempo-interactive t)

     ;; Enable `abbrev-mode' by default.
     (add-hook 'kixtart-mode-hook #'abbrev-mode)
     ;; Enable automatic abbrev expansion with the KiXtart Mode abbrev
     ;; table when outside of comments and strings.
     (setq kixtart-abbrev-table-enabled t)

     ;; Default to using the dos coding system (ASCII character set and
     ;; CRLF line endings) for file names with a .kix extension.
     (add-to-list 'file-coding-system-alist (cons "\\.kix\\'" 'dos))
