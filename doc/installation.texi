The recommended way to install the package is to use an Emacs package
manager.  Using this method should also install the pre-built Info
manual.

To install the package from MELPA, follow the package archive setup
instructions available at @url{https://melpa.org/} and install the
package named ``kixtart-mode''.

Alternatively, the development repository can be cloned to a location
which is present in the Emacs @code{load-path} and made available to
use.

To clone the repository to a local subdirectory:

@example sh
git clone https://git.sr.ht/~mew/kixtart-mode
@end example

The value of @code{load-path} can be modified in the Emacs
configuration, although such a change will need to placed before any
actions which attempt to load the package.  The following example
shows how to load package, assuming that the repository has been
cloned within a directory named "manual-packages" within the user's
".emacs.d" directory:

@example lisp
;; Add the package directory to the load path.
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/manual-packages/kixtart-mode")

;; Load the package.
(require 'kixtart-mode)
@end example
