KiXtart Mode is an Emacs major mode for creating and editing KiXtart
script files.  The following features are implemented:

   * Syntax highlighting for commands, functions, labels, and macros.
   * Indentation based on the usage of commands and parentheses.
   * Motion around and selection of defined functions.
   * Imenu support for function, global variable, and label names.
   * ElDoc support for display of documentation.
   * Completion for built-in syntax (commands, functions, and macros).
   * Code evaluation (requires KiXtart interpreter).
   * Current function name for which-function-mode and add-log
     functions.
   * Outline Mode support.
   * Predefined Tempo templates with optional abbrev expansion.

See the manual for full details.

Installation
============

The recommended way to install the package is to use an Emacs package
manager.  Using this method should also install the pre-built Info
manual.

To install the package from MELPA, follow the package archive setup
instructions available at <https://melpa.org/> and install the package
named "kixtart-mode".

Alternatively, the development repository can be cloned to a location
which is present in the Emacs 'load-path' and made available to use.

To clone the repository to a local subdirectory:

     git clone https://git.sr.ht/~mew/kixtart-mode

The value of 'load-path' can be modified in the Emacs configuration,
although such a change will need to placed before any actions which
attempt to load the package.  The following example shows how to load
package, assuming that the repository has been cloned within a directory
named "manual-packages" within the user's ".emacs.d" directory:

     ;; Add the package directory to the load path.
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/manual-packages/kixtart-mode")

     ;; Load the package.
     (require 'kixtart-mode)

Example configuration
=====================

Assuming that the KiXtart Mode package has been installed by a package
manager and will be autoloaded, the following example demonstrates how
to configure some basic settings, and enable some optional features:

     (with-eval-after-load 'kixtart-mode
       ;; Load the default docstrings.
       (require 'kixtart-docstrings)

       ;; Set indentation and fill preferences.
       (add-hook 'kixtart-mode-hook
                 (lambda ()
                   (indent-tabs-mode 1)
                   (setq tab-width 4)
                   (setq fill-column 80)))

       ;; Enable `abbrev-mode' by default.
       (add-hook 'kixtart-mode-hook #'abbrev-mode)

       ;; Enable automatic abbrev expansion with the KiXtart Mode abbrev
       ;; table when outside of comments and strings.
       (setq kixtart-abbrev-table-enabled t)

       ;; Use case-insensitive symbol completion.
       (setq kixtart-completion-case-fold t)

       ;; Add symbols from the currently loaded TAGS file to the list of
       ;; completion candidate.
       (add-hook 'kixtart-completion-list-hook
                 #'kixtart-completion-include-tags
                 90)

       ;; Enable `electric-layout-mode' by default.
       (add-hook 'kixtart-mode-hook #'electric-layout-local-mode))

     ;; Default to using the dos coding system (ASCII character set and
     ;; CRLF line endings) for file names with a .kix extension.
     (add-to-list 'file-coding-system-alist (cons "\\.kix\\'" 'dos))
