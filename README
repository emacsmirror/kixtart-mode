KiXtart Mode is an Emacs major mode for creating and editing KiXtart
script files.  The following features are implemented:

   * Syntax highlighting for commands, functions, labels, and macros.
   * Indentation based on the usage of commands and parentheses.
   * Motion around and selection of defined functions.
   * Imenu support for function and label names.
   * ElDoc support for display of documentation.
   * Completion for built-in syntax (commands, functions, and macros).
   * Code evaluation (requires KiXtart interpreter).
   * Current function name for which-function-mode and add-log
     functions.
   * Outline Mode support.
   * Predefined Tempo templates with optional abbrev expansion.

See the manual for full details.

Installation
============

The recommended way to install the package is to use a release archive.
Using this method will also install the pre-built Info manual.  The
following example shows shell commands which will extract, configure,
build, and install the package, assuming that the installation should be
system-wide:

     tar -xf kixtart-mode-1.3.2.tar.gz
     cd kixtart-mode-1.3.2
     ./configure
     make
     # System-wide installation will likely require root privileges.
     sudo make install

Alternatively, to use the latest development version of the package, the
repository can be cloned to a location which is present in the Emacs
'load-path'.

To clone the repository to a local subdirectory:

     git clone https://git.sr.ht/~mew/kixtart-mode

The value of 'load-path' can be modified in the Emacs configuration,
although such a change will need to placed before any actions which
attempt to load the package.  The following example assumes that the
repository has been cloned within a directory named "manual-packages"
within the user's ".emacs.d" directory:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/manual-packages/kixtart-mode")

Example configuration
=====================

Assuming that the KiXtart Mode package is currently not loaded, the
following example demonstrates how to load the package, configure some
basic settings, and enable some optional features:

     ;; Load the package by searching in paths listed in `load-path'.
     (require 'kixtart-mode)

     ;; Load the default docstrings.
     (require 'kixtart-docstrings)

     ;; Set indentation and fill preferences.
     (add-hook 'kixtart-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (indent-tabs-mode 1)
                 (setq tab-width 4)
                 (setq fill-column 80)))

     ;; Enable `abbrev-mode' by default.
     (add-hook 'kixtart-mode-hook #'abbrev-mode)
     ;; Enable automatic abbrev expansion with the KiXtart Mode abbrev
     ;; table when outside of comments and strings.
     (setq kixtart-abbrev-table-enabled t)

     ;; Default to using the dos coding system (ASCII character set and
     ;; CRLF line endings) for file names with a .kix extension.
     (add-to-list 'file-coding-system-alist (cons "\\.kix\\'" 'dos))
